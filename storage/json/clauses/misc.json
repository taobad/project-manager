    "p1": "The section and subsection headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be used in interpreting this Agreement. Both parties have had the opportunity to review this Agreement and neither party will be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for the purposes of interpreting any ambiguity in this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement may be signed by manual or facsimile signatures and in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. In the event that any provision of this Agreement will be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be first revised to give the maximum permissible effect to its original intent or, if such revision is not permitted, that specific provision will be eliminated so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.",
